# Snake Game

The Snake game, made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a player-controlled snake that grows by eating food items.     JavaScript manages the game logic including movement, collisions, and score tracking. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without crashing into the walls or the snake's own body.
